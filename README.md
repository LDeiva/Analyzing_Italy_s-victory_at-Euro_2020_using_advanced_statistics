Euro 2024 has come to an end and Italy played a terrible tournament, passing the groups in an unexpected way and exiting in the round of 16 playing one of the worst matches in its history, so what better time to relive one of the best summers of my life as a football fan to banish the disappointment of defeat? 

I am talking about the victory of Euro 2020 by Italy. 

I did it in the best way that I know, celebrating the victory of Italy analyzing with numbers and statistics its path during the competition to understand if the victory was deserved or it was only luck. 

In this article I am analyzing by number how Italy played during the tournament and what statistics tell about the performance.  

Let’s Start. 

**N.B. All statistics and graphs were generated from the analysis of dataframes released free by

**N.B. The player statistics reported, unless otherwise indicated, only take into account players 
who have played at least 180 total minutes in the entire competition. 
And as will be reported they are normalized either for 90 minutes or for possession and for 90 
minutes.**

During group Stage Italy every 90 minutes was the fifth team for XG produced (1.60 XG P90) after Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Denmark but the third for Goal scored (1.94 Goal P90) under only Netherlands and Portugal (Own goals were not counted in this analyses). 

Exluding penalty (Italy had no penalty in favor during group stage) Italy every 90 minute was the fourth team for npXG every (1.6 npXG P90) and second for npGoal scored (1.94 npGoal P90). 

But it gave the best in defense, positioning like the best defense of the group stage (0.23 XG and npXG P90) and with 0 Goal conceded.

In addiction of the quality of actions Italy generated a big volume of shots positioning like the best Team for Shots every 90 Minute (19.42 Shots P90) and for non penalty Shots on target (6.15 npShots on target P90).
