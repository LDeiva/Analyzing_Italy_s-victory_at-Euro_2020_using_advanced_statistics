# Analyzing Italy's victory at Euro 2020 using advanced statistics
Using Statsbomb Data i calculated many advanced statistics to describe from a statistical point of view how Italy won Euro 2020 to understand from the numbers whether they deserved to win.



# Did Italy deserve to win Euro 2020? 

Euro 2024 has come to an end and Italy played a terrible tournament, passing the groups in an unexpected way and exiting in the round of 16 playing one of the worst matches in its history, so what better time to relive one of the best summers of my life as a football fan to banish the disappointment of defeat? 

I am talking about the victory of Euro 2020 by Italy. 

I did it in the best way that I know, celebrating the victory of Italy analyzing with numbers and statistics its path during the competition to understand if the victory was deserved or it was only luck. 

In this article I am analyzing by number how Italy played during the tournament and what statistics tell about the performance.  

Let’s Start. 

**N.B. All statistics and graphs were generated from the analysis of dataframes released free by 
Statsbomb to whom I send a big thank you.**

**N.B. The player statistics reported, unless otherwise indicated, only take into account players 
who have played at least 180 total minutes in the entire competition. 
And as will be reported they are normalized either for 90 minutes or for possession and for 90 
minutes.**

## Group Stage, How Italy Played? 

Italy dominated its group and it allows us to understand the tactical principles with which Coach Mancini sets up the team. 

The number about the offensive productions generated by Italy and that allowed to the other teams help us to describe this domain.

During group Stage Italy every 90 minutes was the fifth team for XG produced (1.60 XG P90) after Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Denmark but the third for Goal scored (1.94 Goal P90) under only Netherlands and Portugal (Own goals were not counted in this analyses). 

Exluding penalty (Italy had no penalty in favor during group stage) Italy every 90 minute was the fourth team for npXG every (1.6 npXG P90) and second for npGoal scored (1.94 npGoal P90). 

But it gave the best in defense, positioning like the best defense of the group stage (0.23 XG and npXG P90) and with 0 Goal conceded.

In addiction of the quality of actions Italy generated a big volume of shots positioning like the best Team for Shots every 90 Minute (19.42 Shots P90) and for non penalty Shots on target (6.15 npShots on target P90).

It was the second Team after Spain for fewer Shots conceded every 90 minutes (3.88 Shots allowed P90) and the third for fewer non penalty shots conceded (3.88 npShots allowed P90). 

It was also the second Team for fewer shots and non penalty shots on target conceded (0.64 Shots and npshots allowed P90).

Let’s analyze the tactical principes that allow Italy to obtain this domain. 

Idea was the control of the matches by the possession of the ball, indeed it was the third team for Possession Percentage during group stage.

Italy used massively the construction from below, Italy was the Team with lower mean pass lenght for goal kick (15,8 m), and Donnarumma was the goalkeeper with the lower mean length pass after Unai Simon (Spain). 

Italy tended to build actions with two central back, the right wing back and the support of a midfielder (Jorginho) bringing the other players into the opposing three-quarters. 

In the following plots the positions of player in possession phase is clearly show. 

<img width="196" height="162" alt="Pass network Italy vs Wales" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2245cf96-b066-484f-90b4-7dbcdc434f2d" />

*In Pass networks of Group Stage matches of Italy is clearly show that Italy carried most of its players in the opponent part of pitch. (Pass networks show connections before the first replacement.)*

Another proof of the tendency to build from the bottom is visible from the map of balls received by players. 

<img width="275" height="424" alt="Ball Receipt zone for Italy Group Stage" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d30ee09b-14ed-489e-8bc7-2a1558041ced" />

*It is clearly that Italy started actions mainly from the bottom and subsequently passed the ball to the players in the opposite half.*

The players with the greatest responsibility in getting the ball to the players positioned in the last third of the pitch were Jorginho and Bonucci. 

They were the players with more Balls received among Italian players (62.9 and 61.9 P90 respectively) and Jorginho was first player among Italian players and in the 91th percentile (among the players that played more 180 minutes in group stage, goalkeepers excluded) for Successful passes in final third and Bonucci was in 95th percentile regarding Progressive successful passes in final third (he was the ninth player for progressive passes in final third P90 during Group stage).
